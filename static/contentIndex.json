They first went up to Landcruiser Hill, then visited the Burnt Mnt, Twyfelfontein and drove down into the Aba-Huab dry river bed and further into the Huab dry river bed. Stop over was at Mushroom Hill and thereafter the group drove into Desolation Valey, visited the Gai-Ais Fountain, as well as a Petified Forest. Afterwards they drove down the Gai-Ais Canyon, then traversed into Zebra Canyon. An old mine shaft was inspected on their way to the Brandberg West pass. The trip then continued up the Ugab and Divorce Pass, where one could walk among a stone Labyrinth situated on a hill. Afterwards they turn off towards Land Cruiser Hill, passing some of Namibia’s famous fairy circles, then drove down Landcruiser Hill. A quick stop was made at De Rust and the trip ended up at White Lady Lodge.\nGreat impressions were the geological foundations as well as the fauna and flora, which had come to life after the arid area had received some early rains. Animals seen were Desert Adapted Elephants, Black Rhino, Giraffe, Springbok various other small animals.\n\nFonteine Community Rest Camp is located in the Twyfelfontein area of Damaraland, Namibia, providing campsites for travelers. It is one of many community-run campsites in the country that are important for local income. When visiting, it’s recommended to book in advance, especially during high season, and be aware that wild camping is not permitted in Namibia.  \n\nLocation: Twyfelfontein area in Damaraland, Namibia.\nServices: Offers campsites for travelers.\nImportance: Contributes to the local community’s income through tourism.\nRegulations: Wild camping is not allowed; visitors should use designated campsites like this one.\nBooking: Booking in advance is crucial, particularly during high season.\n"},"Planning":{"slug":"Planning","filePath":"Planning.md","title":"Planning","links":["Sketch","Van-Zyls-Pass","Purros","Etambura-Camp","Hellivac","Barbara"],"tags":[],"content":"\nBookings:info@namibweb.com\nPayment options\nPacking List\n\n\nErongo Region\nThis region comprises the Swakopmund magisterial district up to the Ugab river and includes the enclave of Walvis Bay, former Damaraland south of the Ugab river, and the Omaruru and Karibib magisterial districts. This region is named after the Erongo mountain, a well known landmark in Namibia and in this area. All the main centres within this region, excepting south of former Damaraland, are connected by tarred roads. Gravel roads link this this part with either Omaruru or Swakopmund. The inclusion of former South Damaraland is necessitated by various services for this part which originate in Omaruru. Postal and telecommunications services for Omatjette, Okombahe and Uis are maintained from Omaruru. Veterinary services for these areas are provided by the State Veterinarian based at Omaruru. The maintenance of roads falls under the Roads Superintendent of Omaruru. Medical services are rendered at the clinics of Omatjette, Okombahe, and Uis by medical personnel and private doctors stationed at Omaruru. The main hospital centre for this area is in Omaruru.\nThe Omaruru, Karibib and Okombahe/Uis/Tsubeses areas are all situated in a semi-arid farming region and have a homogenous farming pattern, which is mostly stock-raising. It also combines communal farming with commercial farming. The needs for production and marketing are therefore very similar and the farming community has a distinct mutual interest which distinguishes their area from the Okahandja/Otjiwarongo areas which are different in various aspects.\nVarious mining operations occur within this region at places such as Navachab and on a smaller scale at places surrounding Uis and the desert area. Karibib also has a marble industry. Walvis Bay is the principle home of Namibia’s fishing industry. Arandis supports mining industry and Swakopmund boasts manufacturing. Arandis is also an Export Processing Zone (EPZ).\nThis region, with its link to the coast of Namibia, is well developed and should not experience any difficulty in functioning as an administrative unit. Facilities such as schools, hospitals and clinics, the supply of electricity and telecommunication services are, with a few exceptions, well established. The linkage of this predominantly farming area with the more developed areas such as Swakopmund and Walvis Bay is territorially justified and can only be to their advantage.\nThe region comprises of six constituencies: Omaruru, Karibib, Brandberg, Arandis, Swakopmund, Walvis Bay.\nKunene Region\nThis region comprises the western part of former Ovambo, Koakoland, Damaraland north of the Ugab river and the Magisterial District of Outjo. This region is named after the Kunene river which forms the north-western border of this particular region. With its large supply of water and its hydro-electric plant, this river will play an increasingly important role in Namibia \nThe main centers of this region are connected by gravel and tarred roads. Opuwo, Khorixas, Kamanjab and Ruacana are linked with constructed gravel roads whereas Khorixas and Kamanjab are in turn linked to Outjo by tarred roads. The communication system of this region, excepting Ruacana, runs from Outjo and is maintained from this centre. The railway line serving most of Region ends at Outjo from where consumer items and other goods are distributed through the region.\nOne of the unique features of this region is its many tourist attractions. Places such as former Kaokoland, Damaraland and Ruacana will become more accessible to tourists once the planned tarred road running from Ruacana to Kamanjab and the coast becomes a reality. With Outjo as one of the two entrance points to the National Etosha Game Reserve, tourism will become a major revenue source to this territory which is otherwise somewhat underendowed with natural resources. \nAt its main centers, the region has facilities such as primary and secondary schools, clinics and hospitals and electrical power supply. Although these facilities are not always sufficient to provide for all the needs of the community, the necessary infrastructure for further development is available. \nFurthermore a lively trade has developed between this western part of former Ovambo and more particularly the people of former eastern Kaokoland. There is also evidence that people from former Ovambo have moved into former Kaokoland and vice versa. \nThe region has been divided into the following six constituencies: Ruacana, Opuwo, Sesfontein, Khorixas, Kamanjab and Outjo.\n\nMaps\nTracks4Africa\nMapcarta\nBrouter\nTrip details\n**Herewith a very short summary of the Namibia tour that is on offer:**  \n  \nKaokoland and Damaraland safari with Khwela Adventures &amp; Specialised Adventures  \n  \n  \nThis includes the following:  \n  \n- All the accommodation fees in Namibia  \n- Tent, stretcher, mattress &amp; camping chair  \n- All cutlery &amp; crockery  \n- Breakfast, lunch packs &amp; supper  \n- Fresh water and Cold drinks  \n- Ice when available - 60% of the trip  \n- Backup and recovery vehicles  \n- Medical officer  \n- Aerial evacuation arrangements with an Evacuation Company. (You will need to notify your medical aid of your intention to ride in Namibia and send us written confirmation of coverage)  \n- Fuel for your bike in the areas where no fuel is available - with the understanding that you fill your bike where it is available. (budget around R1000 for it)  \n- Daily briefing on the route for the day.  \n- Tracks and routes (depending on your preferred format) uploaded to your GPS.  \n- Tools.  \n- Compressors.  \n- Puncture repair equipment.  \n- Satellite phone (For emergencies in the remote areas, where there is no Wi-Fi and you need to re-assure the plaintiff that you are in fact still alive)  \n   \nOur route for the Namibia tour will take you through Damaraland and Kaokoland and you will ride through and see places like Spitzkoppe, Van Zyl&#039;s pass, the Marienfluss, Purros Canyon, Brandberg and much more. Our Namibia trips are usually 12 days in total.  \n  \nWe will also assist in getting your bike to Namibia and back wherever possible at a very reasonable fee. We are based in Loxton and Pretoria and riders that fly to Windhoek will have to get their bikes to us.  \n  \nWe can only take 16 riders per trip, so please make sure you book asap.  \n  \nThese trips are not races. It is a true dual sport adventure in one of the most beautiful and fascinating places on earth. The average rider will in all likelihood stop and take pictures 20 times a day. You will need some degree of skill and experience as we will ride some sand and rocky mountain passes during the trip.  \n  \nYou will have to ride with a camel back, and take re-hydrates daily, as dehydration becomes your worst enemy in the desert.  \n  \n  \nI highly recommend that you give Hardy (our tour leader) a call for any questions that you may have. He would be the best person to speak to regarding the area&#039;s where we conduct our tours, as well as any logistical questions you may have.

It’s not well known, but that’s precisely what makes it so special. It’s a hidden gem and a wonderful place to stop to break up the long journey in Kaokoland, especially if you’re on your way to Opuwo from destinations further south. \nWhat makes it so special? Well, Khowarib is set at precisely the position where the desert begins to meet the tropics. There’s still a desert vibe, but vegetation becomes more lush and – gasp! – there’s even water in the river! It reminds us of the area around the Jatbula Trail in Australia. \nWith not a lot of visitors, Khowarib is also incredibly tranquil. There’s not a ton to do here, but if it’s relaxing you’re after, look no further. \nWhere to Stay in Khowarib\nThere are two places to stay in Khowarib, both of which are fine choices. \nKhowarib Community Campsite \n\nKhowarib Community Camp was one of our favourite campsites in Kaokoland\nWeb site\nPhone: +264 64 402 779\nKey Contacts\nName: Nelo Kasaona\nMobile: +264 81 710 9596\nName: Josephine\nMobile: +264 81 407 9539\nGPS Coordinates\nLatitude: -19.26622009277343800\nLongitude: 13.88366985321045000\n\nKhowaib Lodge - Camping\nWeb site\nCamping\nThe campsite has nine camping pitches benefitting from 220V mains electricity and access to a communal ablution block with hot water showers. Each camp has its light, tap and wash-up area, shade port, maintained braai  (BBQ) area, and a rubbish bin. \nThe campsites at Khowarib have their own restaurant, bar, swimming pool, and lawn area.\n\nRate: N600 - 2 adults\nTel: +264 64 402 779\nCell (Lodge direct): [+264 81 2193291](tel:+264 81 2193291)\nEmail: reservations@khowarib.com\nLodge - Self catering\nLodge - Self catering\nThe en-suite tents are a short walk from the lodge to the river bank and either have a double or twin beds. Viewing platforms extend from the front of each tent, shaded by the plentiful mopani trees but affording splendid views of the gorge. The open-air bathrooms are spacious and well equipped, adding to the feeling of indulgence and relaxation that Khowarib Lodge offers.\nRate: N2150 - per 2 persons\n\n\nCamp sites\nVan Zyls Pass\nWhere to Get Supplies in Kaokoland\nOpuwo is pretty much the only place to stock up on supplies in Kaokoland. Be sure to stock up well, because once you leave Opuwo, you won’t find a hell of a lot else. \nFortunately, you can find most services you need in Opuwo. There are two supermarkets: an OK Food and a Spar – OK Food has a better selection than Spar. There are a number of pharmacies in town if you need any medication. \nThere are plenty of fuel stations and, helpfully, a solid mechanic if you need to get work done or buy a new tire (trust us, you might). If you find yourself in need of tires or a repair, head to Kunene Outfitters, which is in the orange and black building near the OK Food. \nThere are a number of roadside tire repair places in Kaokoland, but they don’t always do the best job. If you need some work on our tires, you’re best off doing so in Opuwo.\nPurros\nPurros\nMarble Camp\nEtambura Camp\nEmergency\nEvacuation\nHellivac\nHellivac\nHospital / Clinics\nDocuments\nIndemnity\nMed aid\nPlease fill out the forms and send them back to me by the 30th of April 2019, along with certified copies of the following documents:\n\n- Id\n- Passport\n- Motorcycle natis document\n\nPlease keep all the original certified documents and forms so that they can be handed to Janco or Hardy on the day that you drop off your motorcycle with one of them.\n\nPlease note that you need to notify your medical aid that you will be traveling in Namibia on motorcycles. We will also need confirmation of coverage from your medical aid or any alternative company you might use for your international travel medical insurance. By providing this information to the evac company ahead of time, it will make the process much smoother in the event of an emergency evac situation.\n\n“Word of advice to the group. Advising your medical insurance (Discovery etc.) that you are headed off into deepest darkest is required but don&#039;t let that provide you with false security. Discovery in particular are particularly useless when it comes to supporting you abroad when the proverbial hits the fan. Taking out a decent travel insurance package actually allows for much faster results when it comes to medical treatment, casa-vacs and the likes thereof.”\n\nOthers that have done similar trips\nBarbara\nWildwood Namibia\nImportant Contacts\nDirkie Baard\nwww.facebook.com/untamedadventuresnamibia\nThis number is on the site: ‪+264 81 295 3807\nJohnny Wildwood\nwww.facebook.com/wildwoodtours\n083 325 2381\nRestrictions\n\nOverlanders from SA to Namibia, take note of these restrictions: no cooked/processed animal products (frozen suppers, meatballs or chicken drumsticks for padkos, ham for sandwiches, cheese, etc) will be allowed to cross the border - unless you have a valid veterinary import permit.

I’ve done it twice before; 2009 with friends and 2019 with Mark Hardy, from Specialised Adventures.\nBoth trips were hyper special - This is a bucket list trip!!\nIt is possible to do the trip without support / backup but we’re doing it in style … a support crew reduces risks and makes thing more comfortable, not to mention the joy of riding without luggage!\nWe will be organising things on our own - based solely on a cost covering drive. We will be leaning on those of you that have experience to help organise and guide the planning.\nWe want to see and explore some of the best parts of that the Kaokaveld and a bit of Damaraland.\nBarabara Muszynski, who’s done extensive research and planning for her own trips has shared her experiences and trip details with me already - giving us a draft version 1 of the route.\nShe has graciously offered to share her experience with us and answer questions - she’s part of this group. (Thanks Minxy)\nIntroducing the other amigos …\nCovering Support and Logistics, we have …\nGeorge Paneras … A Civil engineer and Retired Business man … aka “The negotiator” … He’s done what many dream of … dozens of 4X4 excursions over the last few decades … he’s well aquainted with 4X4 travels, trailers and in particular, Namibia. With Kaokaveld on his CV and having been to many of the spots we’re heading to - we appreciate the part he will play.\nBarry Corbett … a brewmaster by day, IT Tech specialist and a Removal man … the best man to keep us going and our hunger and thirst in check!\nEngineering geeks …\nMike Puzey … a legend in his own right … a mechanical wizard … what he doesn’t know isn’t worth knowing…\nGunther Wurcher … creative steel works guru … Not very good with GPS … got a few scars as evidence of his love for offroad\nAndrew Ernst … a passionate engineer … knows a few things about about tech\nOther amigos…\nDerek Lubbe … A classier architect you’ll struggle to find … has a massive passion for two wheel adventure … spent many weeks touring Namibia on two wheels … also known to strum a good tune\nChris and brother Andrew Ogden … the quite assassins … demons on two wheels … Chris Amageza finisher … EC Based\nLudgwig Buchner (Ludo) … almost good at almost anything … Amageza last man standing … Insurance boff\nMarc (Mooch) … always in for the good times … not scared of much … and got the scars to show for it!\nKeith Lyon … Two wheels is like duck to water -  this trip should put some spice back in his pond\nFlorian Emil … Austrian Nutter .. Anything goes … Ridden Africa top to bottom and back … Need extra beer just for FLo\nNearly 50% Zimbo’s in the lineup … I can see beer planning becoming a top priority\nGeneral Notes:\nRiding will be a mix of gravel, jeeptrack, riverbed and some rocky and mountainous tracks.\nWe will be going over a few passes including the well known van Zyl’s pass. Be prepared for a fair amount of soft sand.\nThe larger the bike the more sweat. 500 - 700cc sized bikes with a minimum of 300kms range are ideal.\nMany of the planned stop overs have campsites and refuelling facilities but there are a few days where we will be very remote - which means good fuel range needed with some reserves on board.\nThere are subgroubs created in this community group. Join the groups you’re interested in following or contributing.\nPlease post in the relevant group. (e.g., don’t drop tyre questions in the Meals group).\nThis is a closed community. Community admins will be myself and the support and logistics team.\nEven though there are names associated with topics everyone is encouraged to participate in the detailed planning …\nThe general plan is to get all the suggestions / ideas and decisions into a single collection for each topic.

Fog has covered the mountain, creating unique and lovely light as the sun rises through it. It stays for few minutes after the sun has climbed a little, and then burns off to produce sunny days. It’s the first time we are experiencing this in spring for a decade.\nThis special spring has created the perfect opportunities for outdoor games and bush breakfasts – and with the beautiful colour all over the mountain, it feels like the landscape is finally waking up after the long, cold winter.\nWildlife\nThe wildlife has become very active too, their movement marked by migrations, breeding, and the birth and care of young ones. Animals are emerging from hibernation, migratory birds are returning, and the plants have new growth. This period sees increased birdsong, and we have more guineafowls than we can count. \nWe’ve seen gentle giraffes following the stream in camp, just a few metres from Rooms 9 and 10, with a beautiful sighting of a giraffe picking fresh leaves in view of camp. \nIt’s a vital time for reproduction and foraging, making it a fascinating season for observing nature. With the blooming of flowers, early spring flies, butterflies and bees are more visible. That said, we are very cautious around the animals as too, as they may be nesting or sheltering. We keep a very safe distance from breeding herds of elephants as they are very protective.\n\nHere’s a detailed summary of what you can expect weather-wise in Damaraland and Kaokaveld (North-West Namibia) in July, plus some practical tips for travelling in that period.\n\nDamaraland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the climate is like\n\nAugust falls into the dry season for Damaraland (and much of Namibia) — low rainfall, clear skies. (Namibia Tours &amp; Safaris)\nDaytime maximum temperatures average around ~ 26-27 °C in July. (SafariBookings.com)\nNight and early morning temperatures drop significantly — typical minimums around ~ 11-12 °C (and sometimes lower, even near freezing in more exposed or higher spots). (SafariBookings.com)\nRainfall is extremely low. Damaraland in August is very dry. (World Weather &amp; Climate Information)\n\nWhat that means in practice\n\nExpect bright sunny days, good for outdoor activities, photography, wildlife spotting.\nMornings and evenings will be chilly, so layers are important — even a fleece or warm jacket would be wise for early morning drives/excursions.\nBecause of the low rainfall and dry conditions, wildlife (especially desert‐adapted) tends to concentrate around limited water sources — good for viewing. (Namibia Tours &amp; Safaris)\nBecause nights are cold, camping or staying in less‐insulated accommodation may feel quite brisk.\n\nTravel tips\n\nPack a warm hat/scarf for early mornings.\nDress in layers: morning cool → midday warmth → evening cool again.\nChoose activities after the early morning chill — you’ll get the best of the day in mid‐morning to afternoon.\nStay hydrated and use sun protection — despite being winter, the sun is bright in the desert.\nRoads will be dry and accessible (in the dry season) — fewer issues with mud or wash‐outs.\n\n\nKaokaveld (Kaokoland)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the climate is like\n\nJuly is also in the core of the dry winter season for the Kaokaveld region. (SafariBookings.com)\nDaytime temperatures typically reach about ~ 20-24 °C in July in Kaokaveld. (Namibia Tours &amp; Safaris)\nMorning / night minimums can go quite low — sometimes ~ 6-11 °C or even lower in exposed areas. (Namibia Tours &amp; Safaris)\nRainfall is extremely rare in this period — very dry and clear. (Expert Africa)\n\nWhat that means in practice\n\nSimilar to Damaraland: clear skies, excellent visibility, and great for wildlife-spotting (e.g., desert‐adapted elephants, rhino) because they converge on the few water sources. (Expert Africa)\nMornings are very cold, especially pre‐sunrise or early in the day.\nMidday will feel quite pleasant (20-24 °C), perhaps even warm when the sun is strong.\nBecause the region can be remote, with fewer services and more rugged terrain, cold mornings plus long days of activity mean you should plan for comfort and safety.\n\nTravel tips\n\nEarly starts will require warm layers (thermal base layer / fleece) and something wind‐resistant (winds pick up in deserts).\nAfter lunch, you’ll likely want lighter layers (short sleeves) but still some protection for the sun.\nEvening again gets cold — plan for a warm drink / jacket by sunset.\nGiven remoteness: carry emergency supplies, ensure vehicle and gear are in good order, make sure your daily plan accounts for slower roads.\nGiven the dryness: respect conservation rules (water is precious), stick to established camps/roads.\n\n\nSummary Comparison\n\nBoth regions share dry winter weather in July: minimal rain, clear skies, excellent for travel.\nDamaraland: Daytime ~ 26-27 °C, nights ~ 11-12 °C; very dry; good for wildlife.\nKaokaveld: Daytime a bit cooler (~ 20-24 °C), nights potentially much colder (~ 6-11 °C); also very dry and fantastic for remote wilderness experiences.\nIn both areas, morning chill and significant diurnal temperature swing → key to pack accordingly.\n"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Namibia 2026 Expedition","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is a blank Quartz installation.\nSee the documentation for how to get started."}}
