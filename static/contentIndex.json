Fitness will play an important role as fatigue is likely to creep in at some point.\n  \nTransport is arranged to getting bikes to Namibia. We will indicate where and when to deliver your bikes and all the mandatory documentation. \n  \nThis expedition is not to make money and is therefore on a cost covering basis.

Riders recommended to use intercom system.\n  \n \n\nErongo Region\nErongo Region\nThis region comprises the Swakopmund magisterial district up to the Ugab river and includes the enclave of Walvis Bay, former Damaraland south of the Ugab river, and the Omaruru and Karibib magisterial districts.\nThis region is named after the Erongo mountain, a well known landmark in Namibia and in this area. All the main centres within this region, excepting south of former Damaraland, are connected by tarred roads. Gravel roads link this this part with either Omaruru or Swakopmund.\nThe inclusion of former South Damaraland is necessitated by various services for this part which originate in Omaruru. Postal and telecommunications services for Omatjette, Okombahe and Uis are maintained from Omaruru. Veterinary services for these areas are provided by the State Veterinarian based at Omaruru.\nMedical services are rendered at the clinics of Omatjette, Okombahe, and Uis by medical personnel and private doctors stationed at Omaruru. The main hospital centre for this area is in Omaruru.\nThe Omaruru, Karibib and Okombahe/Uis/Tsubeses areas are all situated in a semi-arid farming region and have a homogenous farming pattern, which is mostly stock-raising. It also combines communal farming with commercial farming. The needs for production and marketing are therefore very similar and the farming community has a distinct mutual interest which distinguishes their area from the Okahandja/Otjiwarongo areas which are different in various aspects.\nVarious mining operations occur within this region at places such as Navachab and on a smaller scale at places surrounding Uis and the desert area. Karibib also has a marble industry. Walvis Bay is the principle home of Namibia’s fishing industry. Arandis supports mining industry and Swakopmund boasts manufacturing. Arandis is also an Export Processing Zone (EPZ).\nThis region, with its link to the coast of Namibia, is well developed and should not experience any difficulty in functioning as an administrative unit. Facilities such as schools, hospitals and clinics, the supply of electricity and telecommunication services are, with a few exceptions, well established. The linkage of this predominantly farming area with the more developed areas such as Swakopmund and Walvis Bay is territorially justified and can only be to their advantage.\nThe region comprises of six constituencies: Omaruru, Karibib, Brandberg, Arandis, Swakopmund, Walvis Bay.\nKunene Region\nKunene Region\nThis region comprises the western part of former Ovambo, Koakoland, Damaraland north of the Ugab river and the Magisterial District of Outjo. This region is named after the Kunene river which forms the north-western border of this particular region. With its large supply of water and its hydro-electric plant, this river will play an increasingly important role in Namibia. \nThe main centres of this region are connected by gravel and tarred roads. Opuwo, Khorixas, Kamanjab and Ruacana are linked with constructed gravel roads whereas Khorixas and Kamanjab are in turn linked to Outjo by tarred roads. The communication system of this region, excepting Ruacana, runs from Outjo and is maintained from this centre. The railway line serving most of Region ends at Outjo from where consumer items and other goods are distributed through the region.\nOne of the unique features of this region is its many tourist attractions. Places such as former Kaokoland, Damaraland and Ruacana will become more accessible to tourists once the planned tarred road running from Ruacana to Kamanjab and the coast becomes a reality. With Outjo as one of the two entrance points to the National Etosha Game Reserve, tourism will become a major revenue source to this territory which is otherwise somewhat underendowed with natural resources. \nAt its main centers, the region has facilities such as primary and secondary schools, clinics and hospitals and electrical power supply. Although these facilities are not always sufficient to provide for all the needs of the community, the necessary infrastructure for further development is available. \nFurthermore a lively trade has developed between this western part of former Ovambo and more particularly the people of former eastern Kaokoland. There is also evidence that people from former Ovambo have moved into former Kaokoland and vice versa. \nThe region has been divided into the following six constituencies: Ruacana, Opuwo, Sesfontein, Khorixas, Kamanjab and Outjo."},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Namibia 2026 Expedition","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is a blank Quartz installation.\nSee the documentation for how to get started."}}
