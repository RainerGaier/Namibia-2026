### Organ Pipes

Formed as molten lava intruded into older rock (slate/shale), then cooled and contracted, fracturing in such a regular, polygonal pattern. Estimated to be around 130–150 million years old, making it a relic of ancient volcanic activity in the region. Over time, **erosion** exposed these basalt/dolerite columns, creating the dramatic “organ-pipe” effect - The result is striking: a natural “cathedral” of stone, often described as one of the more spectacular examples of basalt columnar jointing in southern Africa — a kind of geological monument to Earth’s volcanic past.

Fee around R250 / NAM$. The visit is short —  10–15 minutes !
