### Back up to the Umaruru river, Uis & White Lady

We head back up to the Umaruru river on a different route. Do about 25kms of riverbed then head to UIS for refuelling.

We will have travelled about 285kms since the start (Henties) so refuelling is essential. It may be prudent for those with shorter fuel range  (i.e. below 300kms) to add some fuel from the storage. As a general rule ... if there's fuel, fill up.

There is a nice spot to quench the thirst (Brandberg White Lady Cafe)

From Uis to Brandberg (White Lady Camp site) is about 35kms.

After the first few nights, the snorers are tagged .... Plenty of space to avoid them ...

There is a restaurant, if preferable ...

Much better to end it this way ...
