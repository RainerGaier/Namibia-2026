> [!attention] Because we’ll be travelling on two wheels with support vehicles, crossing and travelling in several rivers, having up-to-date information on river levels and flow / flood risk is very important. 

We have mapped out all the sections where the major rivers are part of our route. We will utilise local resources to inform us in on the conditions, where possible.

1. Huab river
2. Umaruru rirver
3. Hoarusib river
4. Hoanib river
5. Ugab
