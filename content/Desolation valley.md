On Friday morning, 8th December, the group of ten vehicles left the small town of Uis, to commence the adventourous trip. They first went up to Landcruiser Hill, then visited the Burnt Mnt, Twyfelfontein and drove down into the Aba-Huab dry river bed and further into the Huab dry river bed. Stop over was at Mushroom Hill and thereafter the group drove into Desolation Valey, visited the Gai-Ais Fountain, as well as a Petified Forest. Afterwards they drove down the Gai-Ais Canyon, then traversed into Zebra Canyon. An old mine shaft was inspected on their way to the Brandberg West pass. The trip then continued up the Ugab and Divorce Pass, where one could walk among a stone Labyrinth situated on a hill. Afterwards they turn off towards Land Cruiser Hill, passing some of Namibia’s famous fairy circles, then drove down Landcruiser Hill. A quick stop was made at De Rust and the trip ended up at White Lady Lodge.

Great impressions were the geological foundations as well as the fauna and flora, which had come to life after the arid area had received some early rains. Animals seen were Desert Adapted Elephants, Black Rhino, Giraffe, Springbok various other small animals.
