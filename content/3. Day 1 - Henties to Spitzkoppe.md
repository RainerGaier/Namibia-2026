### Up the Umaruru river

>
>We will confirm the conditions of the riverbeds prior to doing this and other sections of the route, but assuming conditions are good, we'll travel about 80kms inside the Umaruru riverbed, hang right and head down to Spitzkoppe. There is a good chance the support vehicles can follow on the same route. If not, there is an alternate route available, but super corrugated, I'm told.
>
>We will leave early to give us as much time as possible to enjoy the route and to get to Spitzkoppe early as possible - because it such as magical place.

### Spitzkoppe

> 
> The Spitzkoppe is a group of bald granite peaks or inselbergs. The sheer size with voluptuous curves makes this cluster formation so intriguing. The granite is more than 120 million years old and the highest outcrop rises about 1,728 metres above sea level. The peaks stand out dramatically from the flat surrounding plains.

>They have great expansive campsites! There are nice outdoor showers at reception and ablutions spread around. We will have all we need so we were good to camp and have fun riding / driving around.

### Refuelling

> [!Important]
> The next refuel spot is Uis (approx. 135kms). We will have travelled about 150kms, making the refuel point about 285kms - so bikes with ranges < 320kms should add a few litres from the Jerry cans, or carry a fuel 5l bladder, as a safety margin.
