### Up the Umaruru river

We will have to confirm the conditions of the riverbeds prior to doing this and other sections of the route, but assuming conditions are good, we'll travel about 80kms inside the Umaruru riverbed, hang right and head down to Spitzkoppe. There is a good chance the support vehicles can follow on the same route. If not, there is an alternate route available, but super corrugated, I'm told.

### Spitzkoppe

> The Spitzkoppe is a group of bald granite peaks or inselbergs. The sheer size with voluptuous curves makes this cluster formation so intriguing. The granite is more than 120 million years old and the highest outcrop rises about 1,728 metres above sea level. The peaks stand out dramatically from the flat surrounding plains.

### Refuelling

> [!Important]
> The next refuel spot is Uis (approx. 135kms). We will have done about 150kms - for bikes with ranges < 320kms should add a few litres from the Jerry cans, or carry a fuel 5l bladder.
