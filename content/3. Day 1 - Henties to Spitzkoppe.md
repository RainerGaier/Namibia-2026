### Up the Umaruru river

We will have to confirm the conditions of the riverbeds prior to doing this and other section of the route, but assuming conditions are good, we'll travel about 80kms inside the Umaruru riverbed, hang right and head down to Spitzkoppe. There is a good chance the support vehicles can follow on the same route. If not, there is an alternate route available, but super corrugated, I'm told.

The Spitzkoppe is a group of bald granite peaks or inselbergs located between Usakos and Swakopmund in the Namib desert of Namibia. The granite is more than 120 million years old and the highest outcrop rises about 1,728 metres above sea level. The peaks stand out dramatically from the flat surrounding plains
