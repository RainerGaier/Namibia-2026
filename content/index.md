### Summary of the Expedition

>This Expedition will take us through some of the most geographically diverse and sparsely occupied terrain in Namibia ... Damaraland and Kaokoland (the Erongo and Kunene regions); we'll be riding through and seeing some unusual landmarks like Spitzkoppe, Brandberg, Epupa Falls, Van Zyl's pass, the Marienfluss, Purros Canyon, Kowharib Schlucht, Desolation valley and a bunch more. The best part for bikers ... you will be witnessing changing conditions right under you feet every day. 
>
>While the terrain is often rough, we've opted for a mix of roughing it in the open and the occasional luxury lodging.  Unlike some solo travellers without support, we've opted to go for a little more comfort and piece of mind, making travelling lighter and agile to enjoy the time in the saddle and hopefully less fatigue in the sandy, fesh-fesh and rocky conditions. We will be supported by three vehicles who will bring along all the goodies to complete the safety, camping, catering and backup facilities we'll need.

>We will **travel 1,930kms** over 12 days. It is a true dual sport adventure in one of the most beautiful and fascinating places on earth. One needs a  degree of sand and technical riding skill and experience covering some sand and rocky mountain passes during the trip. Fitness will play an important role as fatigue is likely to creep in at some point.
>
>We will trailer all the bikes together, into and out of Namibia. At the appropriate time we will indicate where and when to deliver your bikes and all the mandatory documentation - of which there is a crap load. 
>
>This expedition is not to make money and is therefore on a cost covering basis. We have limited this to 10 riders, all contributing equally to the costs. We will arrange, where possible spares etc. on a return basis.

Some arb information about the region ...
### Erongo Region

<a href="https://www.namibweb.com/erongoregion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erongo Region</a>

This region comprises the Swakopmund magisterial district up to the Ugab river and includes the enclave of Walvis Bay, former <a href="https://www.namibweb.com/damaraland.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damaraland</a> south of the Ugab river, and the Omaruru and Karibib magisterial districts. The region comprises of six constituencies: Omaruru, Karibib, Brandberg, Arandis, Swakopmund, Walvis Bay.

This region is named after the Erongo mountain, a well known landmark in Namibia and in this area. All the main centres within this region, excepting south of former Damaraland, are connected by tarred roads. Gravel roads link this this part with either Omaruru or Swakopmund. 

The inclusion of former South Damaraland is necessitated by various services for this part which originate in Omaruru. Postal and telecommunications services for Omatjette, Okombahe and Uis are maintained from Omaruru. Veterinary services for these areas are provided by the State Veterinarian based at Omaruru. 

The Omaruru, Karibib and Okombahe/Uis/Tsubeses areas are all situated in a semi-arid farming region and have a homogenous farming pattern, which is mostly stock-raising. It also combines communal farming with commercial farming. 

Various mining operations occur within this region at places such as  <a href="https://www.namibweb.com/navachab.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navachab</a> 
 and on a smaller scale at places surrounding Uis and the desert area.  

>[!Info]
>Facilities such as hospitals and clinics, the supply of electricity and telecommunication services are, with a few exceptions, well established.  
>
>Medical services are rendered at the clinics of Omatjette, Okombahe, and Uis by medical personnel and private doctors stationed at Omaruru. The main hospital centre for this area is in Omaruru.

### Kunene Region
  
<a href="https://www.namibweb.com/kuneneregion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kunene Region</a>

This region comprises the western part of former Ovambo, Koakoland, Damaraland north of the Ugab river and the Magisterial District of Outjo. The region has been divided into the following six constituencies: Ruacana, Opuwo, Sesfontein, Khorixas, Kamanjab and Outjo.

This region is named after the Kunene river which forms the north-western border of this particular region. With its large supply of water and its hydro-electric plant, this river will play an increasingly important role in Namibia.   

At its main centres, the region has facilities such as clinics and hospitals and electrical power supply.
