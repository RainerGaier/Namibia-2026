126kms of really diverse and exciting riding - everything from hilly, rocky to hardpack, sandy and even fesh-fesh. Fantastic scenery going through the Klein Serengeti and the Khowarib Schlucht.

We head up the D3706 gravel road for about 50kms, turn right into this 70km section of some amazing wilderness riding. There have been lions spotted, apparently escapees from Etosha, but I'm told if we travel together there won't be a problem.

### Next stop Khowarib Lodge (Self catering tents)

### Camp vibes

The en-suite tents are a short walk from the lodge to the river bank and either have a double or twin beds. Viewing platforms extend from the front of each tent, shaded by the plentiful mopani trees but affording splendid views of the gorge. The open-air bathrooms are spacious and well equipped, adding to the feeling of indulgence and relaxation that Khowarib Lodge offers.
