We packed this expedition into two weeks, unfortunately with no rest day. The general aim is to get to the destination by mid afternoon to relax and enjoy the surrounds.

4 Days (1,2, 14 & 15) are spent travelling to and from Henties bay. The offroad section, which is where the real adventure is, is 12 days!
