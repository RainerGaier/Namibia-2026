Damaraland has a semi-desert climate with a highly variable annual rainfall of about ==13 to 20 inches (330 to 500 mm)==, with the rainy season typically occurring between November and April. Multi-year droughts are common, but occasional heavy rainfall events can happen, sometimes leading to flooding in low-lying areas. 

Rainfall patterns

- **Seasonal:** 
    The main rainy season is from November to April, with occasional thunderstorms in November and peak rainfall from January to March. 
- **Annual average:** 
    The average annual rainfall is approximately 13 to 20 inches (330 to 500 mm), though this can vary significantly. 
- **Variability:** 
    Rainfall is highly variable, and multi-year droughts are a common feature of the region's climate. 
- **Rare events:** 
    Exceptionally heavy rainfall can occur, sometimes described as "once-in-a-decade" events. 
- **Effects of heavy rain:** 
    These rare downpours can cause significant, localized flooding because the ground is not used to absorbing large amounts of water, and drainage systems are minimal. 

Recent rainfall events

- **Summer 2025:** 
    The region experienced a significant "once-in-a-decade" rainfall event in the summer of 2025.
- **Impact:** 
    This rainfall brought new life to the desert, with rivers flowing, vegetation blooming, and improved conditions for the local wildlife, such as the desert-adapted black rhino.

#### Damaraland weather in August

Our temperatures ranged from 14° Celsius mornings to 33° during the day, plus we’ve had very misty mornings for the past two months. Fog has covered the mountain, creating unique and lovely light as the sun rises through it. It stays for few minutes after the sun has climbed a little, and then burns off to produce sunny days. It’s the first time we are experiencing this in spring for a decade.

This special spring has created the perfect opportunities for outdoor games and bush breakfasts – and with the beautiful colour all over the mountain, it feels like the landscape is finally waking up after the long, cold winter.

#### Wildlife

The wildlife has become very active too, their movement marked by migrations, breeding, and the birth and care of young ones. Animals are emerging from hibernation, migratory birds are returning, and the plants have new growth. This period sees increased birdsong, and we have more guineafowls than we can count. 

We’ve seen gentle giraffes following the stream in camp, just a few metres from Rooms 9 and 10, with a beautiful sighting of a giraffe picking fresh leaves in view of camp. 

It’s a vital time for reproduction and foraging, making it a fascinating season for observing nature. With the blooming of flowers, early spring flies, butterflies and bees are more visible. That said, we are very cautious around the animals as too, as they may be nesting or sheltering. We keep a very safe distance from breeding herds of elephants as they are very protective.

## Damaraland

### What the climate is like

- August falls into the dry season for Damaraland (and much of Namibia) — low rainfall, clear skies. ([Namibia Tours & Safaris](https://www.namibia-tours-safaris.com/travel-guide/best-time-to-visit-damaraland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Best Time to Visit Damaraland: Ideal Seasons for Wildlife & Scenery"))
- Daytime maximum temperatures average around **~ 26-27 °C** in July. ([SafariBookings.com](https://www.safaribookings.com/damaraland/climate?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Damaraland Weather & Climate (+ Climate Chart) - Safari Bookings"))
- Night and early morning temperatures drop significantly — typical minimums around **~ 11-12 °C** (and sometimes lower, even near freezing in more exposed or higher spots). ([SafariBookings.com](https://www.safaribookings.com/damaraland/climate?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Damaraland Weather & Climate (+ Climate Chart) - Safari Bookings"))
- Rainfall is extremely low. Damaraland in August is very dry. ([World Weather & Climate Information](https://weather-and-climate.com/damaraland-na-June-averages?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Damaraland Weather in June: Temperature, Rainfall, & More"))

### What that means in practice

- Expect **bright sunny days**, good for outdoor activities, photography, wildlife spotting.
- Mornings and evenings will be **chilly**, so layers are important — even a fleece or warm jacket would be wise for early morning drives/excursions.
- Because of the low rainfall and dry conditions, wildlife (especially desert‐adapted) tends to concentrate around limited water sources — good for viewing. ([Namibia Tours & Safaris](https://www.namibia-tours-safaris.com/travel-guide/best-time-to-visit-damaraland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Best Time to Visit Damaraland: Ideal Seasons for Wildlife & Scenery"))
- Because nights are cold, camping or staying in less‐insulated accommodation may feel quite brisk.

### Travel tips

- Pack a warm hat/scarf for early mornings.
- Dress in layers: morning cool → midday warmth → evening cool again.
- Choose activities after the early morning chill — you’ll get the best of the day in mid‐morning to afternoon.
- Stay hydrated and use sun protection — despite being winter, the sun is bright in the desert.
- Roads will be dry and accessible (in the dry season) — fewer issues with mud or wash‐outs.

![Image](https://www.go2africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kaokoveld21.jpg)

### What the climate is like

- July is also in the core of the **dry winter season** for the Kaokaveld region. ([SafariBookings.com](https://www.safaribookings.com/kaokoland/best-time?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Best Time To Visit Kaokoland (Month by Month)"))
- Daytime temperatures typically reach about **~ 20-24 °C** in July in Kaokaveld. ([Namibia Tours & Safaris](https://www.namibia-tours-safaris.com/travel-guide/best-time-to-visit-kaokoland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Best Time to Visit Kaokoland: Month-by-Month Weather ..."))
- Morning / night minimums can go quite low — sometimes **~ 6-11 °C** or even lower in exposed areas. ([Namibia Tours & Safaris](https://www.namibia-tours-safaris.com/travel-guide/best-time-to-visit-kaokoland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Best Time to Visit Kaokoland: Month-by-Month Weather ..."))
- Rainfall is extremely rare in this period — very dry and clear. ([Expert Africa](https://www.expertafrica.com/namibia/skeleton-coast-and-kaokoland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Skeleton Coast safaris & Kaokoland holidays"))

### What that means in practice

- Similar to Damaraland: clear skies, excellent visibility, and great for wildlife-spotting (e.g., desert‐adapted elephants, rhino) because they converge on the few water sources. ([Expert Africa](https://www.expertafrica.com/namibia/skeleton-coast-and-kaokoland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Skeleton Coast safaris & Kaokoland holidays"))
- Mornings are **very cold**, especially pre‐sunrise or early in the day.
- Midday will feel quite pleasant (20-24 °C), perhaps even warm when the sun is strong.
- Because the region can be remote, with fewer services and more rugged terrain, cold mornings plus long days of activity mean you should plan for comfort and safety.

### Travel tips

- Early starts will require warm layers (thermal base layer / fleece) and something wind‐resistant (winds pick up in deserts).
- After lunch, you’ll likely want lighter layers (short sleeves) but still some protection for the sun.
- Evening again gets cold — plan for a warm drink / jacket by sunset.
- Given remoteness: carry emergency supplies, ensure vehicle and gear are in good order, make sure your daily plan accounts for slower roads.
- Given the dryness: respect conservation rules (water is precious), stick to established camps/roads.

## Summary Comparison

- Both regions share **dry winter weather** in July: minimal rain, clear skies, excellent for travel.
- **Damaraland**: Daytime ~ 26-27 °C, nights ~ 11-12 °C; very dry; good for wildlife.
- **Kaokaveld**: Daytime a bit cooler (~ 20-24 °C), nights potentially much colder (~ 6-11 °C); also very dry and fantastic for remote wilderness experiences.
- In both areas, morning chill and significant diurnal temperature swing → key to pack accordingly.
