A two day cross-country getting the crew, vehicles and riders to Henties bay (1,930kms) - our starting point of the Expedition.

**Day 1** - The support vehicles with the bikes in tow, together with those making their way by road, will have to do the arduous journey into and through Botswana to the Namibian border via the numbing Transkalahari road. Once through the border, the convoy will overnight in Gobabis at the Transkalahari End Resort. Border crossing et al, could be a 15hour day.

**Day 2** - Via Windhoek and Swakopmund to Henties Bay (780kms), stocking up en route for perishables, groceries, drinks, water etc. we'll need for the next 4-5 days.
