There are these beautiful stone sculptures placed around the region. 

They are all postured differently and not always that easy to spot. I've marked the locations of the fella  that will be in the vicinity of our travels. I think we will pass about 8 of the twenty something men. Make sure the "StoneMenEnRoute" layer of the map is turned on. You should see several "Yellow men" locations on the map.
